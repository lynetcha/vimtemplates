        The __init__ method may be documented in either the class level
        docstring, or as a docstring on the __init__ method itself.

        Either form is acceptable, but the two should not be mixed. Choose one
        convention to document the __init__ method and be consistent with it.

        Note:
            Do not include the `self` parameter in the ``Args`` section.

        Args:
            param1 (str): Description of `param1`.
            param2 (:obj:`int`, optional): Description of `param2`. Multiple
                lines are supported.
            param3 (:obj:`list` of :obj:`str`): Description of `param3`.
